Basic installation
==================

Introduction
------------

.. warning:: You should read all the sections in :doc:`03-basic-installation` to ensure safe installation.

This section describes the mechanical and electrical installation of the Armaz motor.

Power sources
-------------

A 115 - 230 V AC (50 - 60 Hz) in the installation area is required. An AC filter is included in each motor for CE compliance.

Hardware requirements
---------------------

The components you will need to complete the basic installation are:

* A PowerCon power cable
* A STOPT emergency stop
* A 3 point XLR cable
* A remote controller. Possible choices are:
  - A VARMO unit.
  - A computer running :doc:`Ertza GUI <ertza:tools>` tool.
  - A computer running any OSC capable interface.
* A data cable to connect the remote to the motor, depending of the remote type 
  (might be a 5 point XLR cable or a cat5 Ethernet cable).

Tools and miscellaneous hardware

* M10 and M8 screws or bolts for mounting the Armaz motor.
* Corresponding spanner for the screws or bolts.

Mechanical installation and cooling requirements
------------------------------------------------

.. warning:: It is essential that you read and understand this section before
    beginning the installation.

.. note:: Avoid locating the Armaz motor immediatly above or beside heat
    generating equipment.

.. note:: Avoid locating the Armaz motor in the vicinity of corrosive
    substances or vapors, metal particles and dust.

.. note:: Falure to meet cooling air flow requirements will reslut in reduced
    product lifetime and/or motor over temperature trips.

The safe operation of this equipment depends upon its use in the environment.
The following points must be considered:

* The Armaz motor `must` be installed indoors, firmly fixed and located so that
  it can only be accessed by qualified technicians using tools.
* The maximum suggested operating altitude is 1000m (330 ft).
* Great care should be taken when mounting the Armaz motor. 
  Armaz motor provides a high torque (up to 300 Nm) and/or a high speed
  (up to 200 rpm) depending variant.
  Mounting plates and support `must` be designed accordingly to provides strength and dampness.
* Depending on the mounting location, care should be taken to design a safe and reliable mounting system.
  Locations such as above people should be avoided. In most cases, a safety cable fixed to the motor is strongly advised.

For effective colling, the Armaz motor must be mounted with the aeration grids
facing up and down. A space of 100 mm below and above the motor should be kept clear.
This ensure that a sufficient airflow can circulate.

The Armaz motor is designed to opertade in an ambient temperature of 0 °C to 40 °C.
Detail characteristics can be found in the :doc:`07-specifications` section.

.. warning:: The metal housing of the motor can become hot (45 °C) during normal operation.
